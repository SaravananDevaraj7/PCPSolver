* Add some unit tests.

* Allow to set a maximum search depth and report corresponding search result: search may stop since there are no more nodes in open list. This is either due to (a) all possible paths are exhausted, (b) some path are still promising but are to deep. In case (a) we need to report that the PCP instance has no match. In case (b) we need to report the PCP instance has no match of length less than x.

* Find out why bigger closedlists, suddenly slow down search. Test whether the threshold increases with more heap space.

* Provide generic way of reading PCP instances. Specify top-bottom-separator, domino-separator, and iteration-order (either top,bottom;top,bottom,... or top;top;...,bottom;bottom;... where the top-bottom-separator is , and the domino-separator is ;).

* Add mask and exclusion method to filters.

* Provide a way to generate a random PCP instance.
** A button "Random..." launches a dialog.
** The dialog lets you choose size and width.
** The instance is written in the correct format in the input textarea. Overwriting any other input.

* Optimize for binary PCP instances.
** Use a bitvector instead of String to represent dominos and configurations.
